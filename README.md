# ia64-docs

### Public IA-64 documentation page

The Itanium ISA finally gets stable (development is stopped).
Manufacturing and shipping Itaniums gets stopped in 2022.  
(See "Public statements")

Thus I finally decided to collect documentation, references (and other information sources) about this interesting architecture.

Feel free to use and contribute.

> **Intel** on Thursday notified its partners and customers that 
> it **would be discontinuing** its Itanium 9700-series (codenamed Kittson) processors, the **last Itanium chips on the market**. 
> Under their product discontinuance plan, Intel will cease shipments of Itanium CPUs in mid-2021, or a bit over two years from now. [...]

> The current-generation octa and quad-core Itanium 9700-series processors were **introduced by Intel in 2017**,

> With the EOL plan for the Itanium 9700-series CPUs in place, 
> it certainly means that **this is the end of the road for the whole Itanium project**, both for HPE **and Intel**. 
> The former has been offering Xeon-based NonStop and Integrity servers for years now, 
> whereas the latter effectively **ceased development of new CPUs featuring the <ins>IA-64</ins> ISA earlier this decade**.
